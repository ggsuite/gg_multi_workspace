/// repository from its former name, so `git ls-remote` on the old
/// organization still succeeds. Deciding by that url is what made
/// `gg do add <name>` offer a repository under an organization the sync had
/// just moved it out of.

/// dependency is looked up the same way — so the lists are memoized: each
